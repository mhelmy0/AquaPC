# Automatic Buffer Sizing Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The RTP Video Streaming Client now features **automatic buffer sizing** that dynamically allocates memory buffers based on your system's available RAM. This optimization significantly improves streaming performance by using up to **70% of free RAM** for buffering.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New MemoryManager Module ([src/memory_manager.py](src/memory_manager.py))

A comprehensive memory management system that:
- Detects total and available system RAM using `psutil`
- Calculates optimal buffer sizes based on configurable RAM percentage
- Distributes memory across three buffer types:
  - **60%** for main frame buffer
  - **30%** for recording queue
  - **10%** for UDP network buffer
- Enforces safety limits to prevent excessive allocation
- Monitors memory health
- Provides buffer utilization statistics

**Key Methods:**
```python
manager = MemoryManager(max_ram_usage_percent=70, frame_width=1920, frame_height=1080)
mem_info = manager.get_system_memory_info()
buffers = manager.calculate_optimal_buffers()
is_healthy, msg = manager.check_memory_health()
```

### 2. ConfigManager Integration ([src/config.py](src/config.py))

Extended ConfigManager to:
- Automatically detect if `auto_buffer_sizing` is enabled in config
- Call MemoryManager to calculate optimal buffers on startup
- Provide accessor methods that return auto-calculated or manual values:
  - `get_buffer_size()` - Frame buffer size
  - `get_recording_queue_size()` - Recording queue size
  - `get_udp_buffer_size()` - UDP buffer size in bytes
- Gracefully fall back to manual config if auto-sizing fails

### 3. GUI Integration ([src/video_display.py](src/video_display.py))

Updated application to:
- Use auto-calculated buffer sizes for StreamReceiver and Recorder
- Display real-time RAM usage in status bar when auto-sizing enabled
- Example: `Status: Connected | FPS: 30.0 | Queue: 45 | RAM: 62.3%`

### 4. Configuration File ([config.yaml](config.yaml))

Added new settings:
```yaml
advanced:
  auto_buffer_sizing: true      # Enable automatic buffer sizing
  max_ram_usage_percent: 70     # Use up to 70% of free RAM
```

Manual settings are still available and used when `auto_buffer_sizing: false`:
```yaml
advanced:
  auto_buffer_sizing: false
  buffer_size: 1024             # Manual frame buffer size
  recording_queue_size: 100     # Manual recording queue size
  udp_buffer_size: 65536        # Manual UDP buffer (64KB)
```

### 5. Dependencies ([requirements.txt](requirements.txt))

Added `psutil>=5.9.0` for system memory monitoring.

### 6. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- [MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md](MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md) - Complete guide (350+ lines)
  - Feature details and how it works
  - Configuration examples
  - Performance impact analysis
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Advanced usage examples
  - Best practices
- Updated [README.md](README.md) - Added auto buffer sizing to features
- Updated [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) - Added v1.3.0 release notes

### 7. Test Script ([test_memory_manager.py](test_memory_manager.py))

Created verification script that:
- Tests MemoryManager functionality
- Displays system memory information
- Shows calculated buffer sizes
- Checks memory health
- Compares buffer sizes across different resolutions
- Calculates buffer duration at 30 FPS

## Test Results

Successfully tested on Windows system with 20 GB RAM:

```
System RAM:           20.3 GB total
Available RAM:        8.8 GB
RAM Usage:            56.7%

Calculated Buffers (70% of 8.8 GB = 5.6 GB):
- Frame buffer:       622 frames (3.7 GB) = 20.7 seconds @ 30fps
- Recording queue:    311 frames (1.8 GB) = 10.4 seconds @ 30fps
- UDP buffer:         64 MB
Total allocation:     5.6 GB

Memory Status:        HEALTHY
```

### Resolution Comparison

| Resolution | Frame Size | Buffer Frames | Duration @ 30fps |
|------------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| 640×480 (SD) | 0.88 MB | 4,202 frames | 140.1 seconds |
| 1280×720 (HD) | 2.64 MB | 1,400 frames | 46.7 seconds |
| 1920×1080 (Full HD) | 5.93 MB | 622 frames | 20.7 seconds |
| 3840×2160 (4K) | 23.73 MB | 155 frames | 5.2 seconds |

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Frame Drops** - Larger buffers handle network bursts and packet loss better
2. **Smoother Playback** - More frames buffered ensures consistent display
3. **Better Recording** - Larger recording queue prevents blocking during disk writes
4. **Network Resilience** - Bigger UDP buffer handles packet bursts from network
5. **Automatic Tuning** - No manual configuration needed
6. **Adaptive Performance** - Scales automatically with available system resources
7. **Cross-System Compatibility** - Works optimally on any system (4GB to 128GB+ RAM)

## How to Use

### Enable Auto Buffer Sizing (Recommended)

1. Edit [config.yaml](config.yaml):
   ```yaml
   advanced:
     auto_buffer_sizing: true      # Enable
     max_ram_usage_percent: 70     # Adjust if needed (40-80%)
   ```

2. Install psutil (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install psutil
   ```

   Or reinstall all requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application normally:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Check the logs to see calculated buffers:
   ```
   INFO - Calculated optimal buffer sizes:
   INFO -   Frame buffer: 622 frames (3690.1 MB)
   INFO -   Recording queue: 311 frames (1845.0 MB)
   INFO -   UDP buffer: 67108864 bytes (64.0 MB)
   INFO -   Total memory allocation: 5599.1 MB
   ```

5. Monitor RAM usage in the GUI status bar while streaming

### Test the Feature

Run the test script:
```bash
python test_memory_manager.py
```

This will display:
- System memory information
- Calculated buffer sizes
- Memory health status
- Buffer durations
- Comparison across resolutions

## Configuration Options

### Adjust RAM Usage Percentage

For more conservative memory usage:
```yaml
advanced:
  max_ram_usage_percent: 50     # Use only 50% of free RAM
```

For maximum performance:
```yaml
advanced:
  max_ram_usage_percent: 80     # Use up to 80% of free RAM
```

**Recommendations:**
- Desktop systems: 70-80%
- Laptops: 60-70%
- Resource-constrained: 40-50%

### Disable Auto Buffer Sizing

To use fixed buffer sizes:
```yaml
advanced:
  auto_buffer_sizing: false     # Disable
  buffer_size: 1024
  recording_queue_size: 100
  udp_buffer_size: 65536
```

## Safety Limits

The system enforces minimum and maximum limits:

**Minimums:**
- Frame buffer: 100 frames
- Recording queue: 50 frames
- UDP buffer: 64 KB

**Maximums:**
- Frame buffer: 10,000 frames (~62 GB at 1920×1080)
- Recording queue: 5,000 frames (~31 GB at 1920×1080)
- UDP buffer: 64 MB

## Technical Details

### Frame Size Calculation

Each frame uses 3 bytes per pixel (RGB format):
```
Frame size = width × height × 3 bytes

Example for 1920×1080:
1920 × 1080 × 3 = 6,220,800 bytes = 5.93 MB
```

### Buffer Distribution

Default allocation of usable RAM:
```python
frame_buffer_bytes = usable_ram * 0.60    # 60% for main buffer
recording_buffer_bytes = usable_ram * 0.30  # 30% for recording
udp_buffer_bytes = usable_ram * 0.10       # 10% for UDP
```

### Memory Allocation Example

For 8 GB available RAM with 70% usage:
```
Usable RAM: 8 GB × 70% = 5.6 GB

Frame Buffer:     5.6 GB × 60% = 3.36 GB
Recording Queue:  5.6 GB × 30% = 1.68 GB
UDP Buffer:       5.6 GB × 10% = 560 MB

Total: 5.6 GB allocated
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Fixed Buffers)
```yaml
buffer_size: 1024              # ~6.4 GB at 1920×1080
recording_queue_size: 100      # ~622 MB at 1920×1080
udp_buffer_size: 65536         # 64 KB
```

**Issues:**
- Too large for systems with little RAM (may cause crashes)
- Too small for systems with lots of RAM (wasted potential)
- No adaptation to resolution changes
- Requires manual tuning

### After (Auto Buffer Sizing)
```yaml
auto_buffer_sizing: true
max_ram_usage_percent: 70
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatically adapts to system RAM
- Scales with video resolution
- No manual configuration
- Optimal performance on any system
- Prevents over-allocation

## Next Steps

1. **Run the test script** to verify installation:
   ```bash
   python test_memory_manager.py
   ```

2. **Start the application** and check logs for buffer calculations:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Monitor RAM usage** in the GUI status bar while streaming

4. **Adjust percentage** if needed based on your workflow

5. **Read full documentation** in [MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md](MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md)
