# Quick Troubleshooting Reference

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Stream Disconnects After Few Minutes

**Symptoms:**
- Log shows: "Incomplete frame received, stream may have ended"
- Connection drops after 1-8 minutes
- Manual reconnection required

**Solutions Applied ✅:**
1. **Stream Timeout** - Now detects dead streams within 10 seconds
2. **Auto-Reconnect** - Automatically reconnects up to 10 times
3. **Error Tolerance** - Allows up to 5 consecutive incomplete frames before giving up

**Configuration** ([config.yaml](config.yaml:56-62)):
```yaml
advanced:
  stream_timeout: 10.0              # Increase if needed
  auto_reconnect: true              # Enable auto-reconnect
  max_reconnect_attempts: 10        # 0 = infinite retries
  reconnect_interval: 5             # Wait 5s between attempts
```

**Check Logs:**
- `logs/errors.log` - See exact error
- `logs/events.log` - Track reconnection attempts

### Issue: Recording Causes Hang or Frame Drops

**Symptoms:**
- Application freezes when recording
- Video stream stutters during recording
- High CPU usage when recording

**Solutions Applied ✅:**
1. **Async Recording** - Disk writes happen in background thread
2. **Write Queue** - Buffers up to 100 frames
3. **Non-Blocking** - Main thread never waits for disk

**Configuration** ([config.yaml](config.yaml:65-66)):
```yaml
advanced:
  recording_async: true              # Enable async recording
  recording_queue_size: 100          # Increase for slow disks
```

**Monitor:**
- Check `logs/warnings.log` for "Recording queue full" messages
- If frequent, increase `recording_queue_size` to 200+

---

### Issue: Application Hangs Indefinitely

**Symptoms:**
- Application stops responding
- No log output
- Must kill process

**Solutions Applied ✅:**
1. **Stream Timeout** - Prevents indefinite waits
2. **Health Monitoring** - Checks stream every 2 seconds
3. **Graceful Shutdown** - Proper cleanup on errors

**Configuration** ([config.yaml](config.yaml:56-57)):
```yaml
advanced:
  stream_timeout: 10.0                    # Timeout for stream reads
  stream_health_check_interval: 2.0       # Check health every 2s
```

### Issue: No Connection to Server

**Symptoms:**
- "Connection refused" in logs
- Can't connect to Raspberry Pi
- Immediate disconnect

**Check:**
1. **Network**: `ping 192.168.100.41`
2. **Server**: Is FFmpeg streaming running on Pi?
3. **Firewall**: Is UDP port 5000 open?
4. **IP Address**: Correct in config.yaml?

**FFmpeg Error Monitoring ✅:**
- Now logs FFmpeg stderr to `logs/errors.log`
- Connection errors automatically detected
- Clear error messages in logs

## Log Files Guide

### logs/app.log
**Purpose**: All application activity
**Check For**: General flow, what's happening
**Example**:
```
2025-10-20 23:00:00 - StreamReceiver - INFO - Stream receiver started
2025-10-20 23:00:01 - ConnectionManager - INFO - Connection established
```

### logs/errors.log
**Purpose**: Only errors
**Check For**: Why something failed
**Example**:
```
2025-10-20 23:10:00 - StreamReceiver - ERROR - Stream timeout - no data for 10.1s
2025-10-20 23:10:01 - StreamReceiver - ERROR - FFmpeg process terminated unexpectedly
```

### logs/warnings.log
**Purpose**: Warnings (non-fatal issues)
**Check For**: Frame drops, queue overflows
**Example**:
```
2025-10-20 23:05:00 - StreamReceiver - WARNING - Incomplete frame received: 2000000/2764800 bytes
2025-10-20 23:05:01 - Recorder - WARNING - Recording queue full, dropping frame
```

### logs/events.log
**Purpose**: Major events (connect, record, snapshot)
**Check For**: Timeline of what happened
**Example**:
```
2025-10-20 23:00:00 - event - INFO - [STARTUP] Application started
2025-10-20 23:00:05 - event - INFO - [CONNECTION] Stream connection CONNECTED
2025-10-20 23:05:00 - event - INFO - [RECORDING] [STARTED] recording_20251020_230500.mp4
2025-10-20 23:10:00 - event - INFO - [RECONNECT] Attempt 1
```

## Quick Configuration Tuning

### For Unstable Network:
```yaml
advanced:
  stream_timeout: 15.0               # More tolerant (was 10.0)
  max_reconnect_attempts: 20         # More retries (was 10)
  frame_drop_threshold: 15           # Drop more frames (was 10)
```

### For Slow Disk (USB drive):
```yaml
advanced:
  recording_async: true              # MUST be true
  recording_queue_size: 200          # Larger buffer (was 100)
```

### For Debugging:
```yaml
advanced:
  log_level: "DEBUG"                 # More verbose logs
```

## Testing After Fixes

### 1. Basic Connection Test
```bash
python main.py
# Click "Connect"
# Should connect within 5 seconds
# Check logs/events.log for "CONNECTED"
```

### 2. Disconnection Recovery Test
```bash
# While streaming:
# 1. Stop server on Raspberry Pi
# 2. Wait 10 seconds
# 3. Restart server
# Expected: Auto-reconnects within 15 seconds
# Check: logs/events.log for "RECONNECT"
```

### 3. Recording Stability Test
```bash
# While streaming:
# 1. Start recording
# 2. Stream should remain smooth
# 3. Stop after 5 minutes
# Expected: No hangs, video file created
# Check: logs/warnings.log for frame drops
```

### 4. Long Duration Test
```bash
# Let stream run for 30+ minutes
# Expected: No disconnections (or auto-reconnects if any)
# Check: logs/errors.log should be empty or minimal
```

## Performance Expectations

### CPU Usage
- Streaming only: 10-20%
- Streaming + Recording: 15-25%
- During reconnect: Brief spike to 30%

### Memory Usage
- Base: 120-150 MB
- With recording: 150-220 MB
- Stable over time (no leaks)

### Network
- Bandwidth: 2-6 Mbps incoming
- Packet loss tolerance: Up to 5% handled gracefully

---

## When to Adjust Settings

### Increase stream_timeout if:
- Network has high latency (>100ms)
- Frequent false timeouts in logs
- Rural/wireless connection

### Increase recording_queue_size if:
- "Recording queue full" warnings frequent
- Using USB 2.0 drive or network storage
- Recording at high resolution (1920x1080)

### Decrease frame_drop_threshold if:
- Want lower latency (<200ms)
- Powerful PC with good network
- Can tolerate more frame drops

### Increase max_reconnect_attempts if:
- Server restarts frequently
- Network is intermittent
- Want persistent connection

---

## Emergency Commands

### Kill hung process:
```bash
# Windows
taskkill /F /IM python.exe

# Linux/Mac
pkill -9 python
```

### Clear all logs:
```bash
# Windows
del /Q logs\*.log

# Linux/Mac
rm -f logs/*.log
```

### Reset to defaults:
```bash
git checkout config.yaml
```

---

## Getting Help

### 1. Check logs first:
```bash
# See errors
cat logs/errors.log

# See timeline
cat logs/events.log

# See all activity
cat logs/app.log
```

### 2. Run with debug logging:
```bash
python main.py --log-level DEBUG
```

### 3. Include in bug report:
- OS and Python version
- Last 50 lines of logs/errors.log
- Last 50 lines of logs/events.log
- config.yaml settings
- Network setup (WiFi/Ethernet, distance to Pi)
